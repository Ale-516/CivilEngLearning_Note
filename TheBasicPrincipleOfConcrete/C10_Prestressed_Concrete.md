## Definition
* Prestressing is the deliberate creation of internal stresses in a structure or system to improve its performance.
* A prestressed concrete member is one in which there have been introduced internal stresses of such a magnitude, and also distribution, that the stressed resulting from external loading are counteracted to a desired degree.

## The Reasons to Use PC
### Differences between RC and PC
* Tensil Strength: For RC, tensile strength is assumed be negligible; for PC, 
### Advantage of Prestressed Concrete
* High strength steel & concrete
* Lighter section, longer spans
* Entire section is active
* Creckless
* Deflection control
* Better shear resistance
* Inherent safety
* Indirect long-term savings is large
### Disadvantage of Prestressed Concrete
* Higher material costs
* Prestressing is an added cost
* Formworking is more complex than RC
* not as ductile as RC
