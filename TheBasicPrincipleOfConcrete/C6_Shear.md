# SHEAR
## To Begin with
* Concrete is quite strong in shear. Therefore shear by itself does not create any serious problems in RC members. However, principle tensile stress caused by shear combined with other stress create a serious problem since the tensile strength of concrete is very low.
* Mohr's Circle Theory  

## Generalized Shear Span-to-Depth Ratio
* For beam under distributed load or sections the second or the concentrated load acting:
  $$
  \lambda = \frac{M}{Vh_0}  
  $$
## Failure Modes
### Diagonal Compression Failure $\lambda < 1$
* Diagonal cracks appear at the web, then propagate towards the loading point and support. With the load increasing, more cracks appear and are parallel to one another, finally the incline column between two major cracks is crushed.
### Shear Compression Failure $1 < \lambda < 3$
* Digonal cracks appear at the bottom of the beam. After propagating a small distance upright, the cracks start to extend aslant. Among all the cracks, a critical diagnal crack gradually reduces the height of the compression zone. Finally, the concrete at the section top is crushed, which means the member is failed.
### Diagonal Splitting Failure $\lambda > 3$
* Digonal cracks appear at the bottom of the beam. Once appearing, the diagnonal crack rapidly propagates towards the loading point and split the beam into half.
* **All three failures are brittle** but then the beam capacities are different: diagnal compression > shear compression > diagnal spliting
