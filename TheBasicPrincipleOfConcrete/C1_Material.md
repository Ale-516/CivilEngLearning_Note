### Knowledge 01: Three Compression Strength
01. **Cube Strength $f_{cu}, f_{cu,k}$**  
    * **Standard Curing Method**: The specimen is a 150mm $\times$ 150mm $\times$ 150mm cube which is cured for 28 days in a standard curing chamber, under a temperature of $ 20\pm3 $ degree, a relative humidity > 90%. Then tested in the direction normal to the direction it was cast **without greasting the contact surface.**  

    $$
    f_{cu}=\mu_f-1.645*\sigma_f
    $$

    * **Hoop effect**: The transverse friction between the surface of the specimen and the loading plate of the testing machine causes the upper and bottom of the specimen under multi-axial loading state,just as restaining the specimen with two hoops. So two opposite **pyramids** are formed by shear failure.

    * **Size Effect**: The cube strength increases with the decrease of the dimension of specimens.
    $$
    f_{cu}=0.95f_{cu,100} 
    $$
    $$
    f_{cu}=1.05f_{cu,200}
    $$

02. **Prism Strength $f_{ck}$**
    * The compressive strength of prismatic specimens are in good accordance with that of axially loaded short columns. So **the prismatic strength is the real uniaxial compressive strength** of concrete. And 150mm $\times$ 150mm $\times$ 150mm is the standard size. 
03. **Cylinder Strength $f_c'$**  
    * In the USA, Canada, Japan, Europe Union... cylinder specimens of d=150mm, h=300mm are adopted to measure the compressiver strength of concrete.

    $$
    f_c'=0.79f_{cu}
    $$
04. **Modulus of Elasticity**
    * There are three modulus: **initial Modulus of Elasticity($E_c$), secant modulus($E_c'$), tangent modulus($E_c''$)** 
    * Here are the definitions:
    $$
    E_c=\sigma_c/\varepsilon_{ela}
    $$
    $$
    E_c
    $$
### Knowledge 02: Tension Strength
01. **Tension experiments**
    * Direct Pulling Test
    * Splitting Test
    * Flexure Test
02. **Relative value**  
    Concrete has a very low tensile strength it is approximately 10% of   compressive strength($f_c$)

### Knowledge 03: Shear Strength
02. **outline**
    * Shear Strength is not of a primary inportance.Because concrete usually doesn't fail in shear. Because shear strength of concrete is about 35%~80% of its compressive strength, higher than the tensile strength. Even when concrete is subjected to pure shear, it fails due to principal tensile stress. incase of pure shear.
### Knowledge 04: Fatigue Strength
### Knowledge 05: Multi-axial Behavior of Concrete
### Knowledge 05: Confined Concrete
### Knowledge 05: Creep
01. **definition**
    * Keeping load constant, the deformation increases with time. And creep strain may be 1~4 times of the instantaneous elastic strain.
02. **Disadvantage**
    * Large deformation, and prestress loss
03. **Advantage**
    * Mitigate stress concentration, and adjust additional stresses caused by settlement difference and temperature.
### Knowledge 06: Shrinkage
01. **definition**
    * When concrete loses moisture by evaporation, it shrinks. Concrete can complete 1/2 shrinkage in the first month, then continuously increase in a lower rate until reaches a stable value of about $2 \times 10^{-4} \sim 5\times10^{-4}$, which is generate taken as $ 3 \times 10 ^ {-4} $.
02. **disadvantages**
    * If restrained, shrinkage can cause cracking of concrete and will generally cause the deflection increase with time
